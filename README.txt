---Spaceship Sim v1.0 by James Haywood---
Welcome to Spaceship Sim! In this game, you are a random civilian with nothing but a medium sized shuttle and a handful of 
credits to your name. You must trade and sometimes fight your way to the top! 

Please note: All commands are in capitals.

Please note: If you make in an invalid choice in almost all menus, it will take you back to the main command line.
For example, if you use NAV, but then enter a 3 instead of a 1 or 2, you will have to use NAV again to try again.
