# About
In the distant future, where man can traverse the endless light-years between the seven stars of the Unified Stellar Republic in a heartbeat, you have acquired your first spacecraft. Little more than a hypergate-capable shuttle, you must trade and fight your way to the top - or die trying.  It's a harsh galaxy, where pirates roam the furthest reaches of space and no one will come to help you, even if they hear your cry.  Can you survive and thrive among The Seven Suns?

The Seven Suns is a Python game I made over the course of about two weeks in my school Computer Science class. It has exactly 1693 lines of code, and includes a .py file that uses cx_Freeze to create a windows executable of the game, if you so desire.

Some features include:
- Several handmade star systems with unique descriptions of each body, different prices for goods, and danger levels.
- Saving and loading games
- Random turn-based battles when travelling, against enemies with random stats, plus different moves with varying effects and ammo
- Multiple ships (and upgrades) to purchase with different capabilites and capacities
- Trading various goods between star systems for profit
- Sound effects and battle music
