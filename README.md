# About
The Seven Suns is a Python game I made over the course of about two weeks in my school Computer Science class. It has exactly 1693 lines of code, and includes a .py file that uses cx_Freeze to create a windows executable of the game, if you so desire.

Some features include:
- Several handmade star systems with unique descriptions of each body, different prices for goods, and danger levels.
- Saving and loading games
- Random turn-based battles when travelling, against enemies with random stats, plus different moves with varying effects and ammo.
- Multiple ships (and upgrades) to purchase with different capabilites and capacities
- Trading various goods between star systems for profit
- Sound effects and battle music
